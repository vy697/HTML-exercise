    <h3>I have lived in...</h3>
    <p>
    My journey began in Greeley, where I was born. My parents decided to move their electric assembly company to Thailand, so off to Bangkok we went! Then they wanted to expand the business so next stop was Ho Chi Minh City. We came back to Colorado when I was 9 to be closer to the family. I got bit bad by the travel bug so when I got old enough to travel on my own I packed up and moved to Costa Rica for the summer. A year later I decided to study abroad in Sevilla, Spain, and fell in love with the city and its people. And there I stayed for nine years! Until last October, when I decided to come back home to go back to school.

    <h3>I would love to go to...</h3>
    I've been told that Berlin is the San Francisco of Europe, and with S.F. being my favorite U.S. city I'm dying to see the European version. Singapore has always seemed magical to me because of its eclectic mix of cultures and people. And Salvador de Bahia because I want to learn how to samba!
